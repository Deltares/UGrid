/*! \mainpage netCDF C++ Interface Guide

 \section intro_sec Introduction

  Lynton Appel, of the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) in
  Oxfordshire, has developed and contributed a new %netCDF-4 C++
  interface, which is included in %netCDF version 4.1.1.  The %netCDF-4
  C++ API was developed for use in managing fusion research data from
  CCFE's innovative MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) experiment.

  Appel's C++ implementation is a complete read/write interface for
  %netCDF-4, but can also be used as an alternative to the older %netCDF-3
  C++ interface, to write classic-format %netCDF-3 files as well as
  %netCDF-4 classic model files.  The new API is implemented as a layer
  over the %netCDF-4 C interface, which means bug fixes and performance
  enhancements in the C interface will be immediately available to C++
  developers as well.  It replaces a previous partial
  %netCDF-4 C++ interface developed by Shanna Forbes.

  The new API makes use of standard C++ features such as namespaces,
  exceptions, and templates, none of which were included in the first
  %netCDF-3 C++ API developed in the mid-90's.  The earlier %netCDF-3 C++
  API is still supported and available in the source distribution, but
  devvelopers who are thinking of eventually upgrading to use of the
  enhanced data model should consider using Lynton's new API.

  We're grateful for Appel's development and CCFE's contribution of the
  new open-source code for the %netCDF-4 C++ API, and hope C++ developers
  in the %netCDF community will find it useful!  Feedback is appreciated,
  and should be directed to <Lynton.Appel@ccfe.ac.uk>.

 \section install_sec Installation

 Installing the C++ interface requires the additional flag --enable-netcdf-4 to be used during the 
 configure stage of the installation, ie example enter
\verbatim
 ./configure --enable-cxx-4 [plus other options]
\endverbatim
 To build the C++ interface guide, change to the cxx4 directory of the netCDF distribution and enter 
\verbatim
  doxygen 
\endverbatim
 By default html documentation will be installed in cxx4/doc/html; other options may be specified according to the settings contained in the file "Doxfile" (details of alternative settings are documented at http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).
 Note that as a prerequisite for generating the documentation, the system will need to have doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen) and Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org)installed.
