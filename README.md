The library also offers APIs to get data variables and the attributes names/values of topological entites.

## Build

The requirements are:
- CMake 3.19 or higher

On windows precompiled boost binaries (with MSVC compiler) can be downloaded here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ 

Once installed, modify boost environmental variables accordingly. For example:
```powershell
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR=C:\Apps\boost_1_74_0
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\Apps\boost_1_74_0\lib64-msvc-14.2
```
### IDE
