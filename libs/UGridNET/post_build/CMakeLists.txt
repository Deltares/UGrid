# It would be cool to use TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS which is described here
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#genex:TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS
# Unfortunately ZLIB, which is an HDF5 dependency, does not provide an IMPORTED_LOCATION (dll path),
# so it does not make it to the list of run time dependencies. 
# Besides, UGrid is a static library and TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS works with executables, modules and shared libraries.
# The runtime dependencies are set manually here.
